# Pitch Detection using FFT
## Code is best viewed in Jupyter notebook.
## There are several .mp3 files containing different Scales. Feel free to try out the code.
FFT analysis is carried out on the audio file to find out the fundamental frequency and then the frequency is mapped to the correct musical scale.
